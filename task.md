# Instabug Cross-Platform Developer Task

* Create a React Native module for the two following iOS and Android frameworks.
	* [IBGxNetworkManager - iOS](https://github.com/Instabug/cross-platform-task/raw/master/IBGxNetworkManager.zip): used to create and run HTTP requests conveniently.
	* [Instacapture - Android](https://github.com/Instabug/cross-platform-task/raw/master/Instacapture.zip): used to capture a screenshot of all the current content on a screen.
* The modules should enable developers to use those two native frameworks in their React Native apps.
* Module should map at least one API from the ones provided by the native modules.
* Create a sample app for each framework that demonstrates how the modules you created can be used.
* **Bonus:** create a Xamarin, Cordova or Unity plugin for one the native frameworks.

## Deliverables

* Create _local_ Git repos and commit to them regularly while working on the code. When you're done, archive the directories of the repos (including your `.git` directory) and send it our way. 
* You should be delivering 2 modules for `IBGxNetworkManager` and `Instacapture`, in addition to 2 sample apps, one for each framework.


Good luck! üçÄ
